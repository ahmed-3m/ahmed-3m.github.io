# An Overview of Computer Vision Techniques

Computer vision enables machines to "see" and interpret the visual world. As one of the most exciting areas of AI, it's transforming industries from healthcare to autonomous vehicles.

## Fundamental Techniques

Several key techniques form the foundation of computer vision:

### Image Classification

Image classification involves categorizing an image into one of several predefined classes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized this task, with architectures like ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet pushing the boundaries of accuracy.

### Object Detection

Object detection goes beyond classification by identifying and localizing multiple objects in an image. Popular frameworks include:

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Provides real-time object detection
- **Faster R-CNN**: Two-stage detector with high accuracy
- **SSD (Single Shot Detector)**: Balances speed and accuracy

### Semantic Segmentation

Semantic segmentation classifies each pixel in an image, allowing for precise boundary detection. U-Net and DeepLab are common architectures for this task.

## Recent Advances

The field continues to evolve rapidly:

1. **Transformers in Vision**: Models like Vision Transformer (ViT) apply the transformer architecture from NLP to vision tasks.

2. **Self-Supervised Learning**: Techniques that learn from unlabeled data are reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.

3. **Generative Models**: Diffusion models and GANs can generate and manipulate images with increasing realism.

## Applications in My Work

In my research on anomaly detection for industrial inkjet printing, I've applied several computer vision techniques to identify defects in printed materials. By combining traditional computer vision methods with deep learning approaches, we've achieved promising results in identifying subtle printing anomalies.
