&lt;p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and AI as a whole. From GPT-4 to Claude and Llama, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in mastering LLMs but don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start, this 5-month roadmap will guide you from the basics to advanced implementation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing code that follows specific instructions to accomplish a task, you train a model on examples, and the model learns patterns from the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning</title><link>https://ahmed-3m.github.io/blogs/first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ahmed-3m.github.io/blogs/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="getting-started-with-ai-and-machine-learning">Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning&lt;/h1>
