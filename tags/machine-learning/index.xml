&lt;p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing code that follows specific instructions to accomplish a task, you train a model on examples, and the model learns patterns from the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning</title><link>https://ahmed-3m.github.io/blogs/first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ahmed-3m.github.io/blogs/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="getting-started-with-ai-and-machine-learning">Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Hey there, future AI whisperer! ðŸ‘‹&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, you&amp;rsquo;ve heard the buzz about Large Language Models (LLMs) â€“ things like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude â€“ and you&amp;rsquo;re thinking, &amp;ldquo;How does that magic actually work? And could I learn it?&amp;rdquo; The answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;YES&amp;rdquo;, but like any epic question, it requires a map.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Forget dense textbooks for a moment. This is your 5-month, down-to-earth guide to understanding, using, and maybe even building with LLMs. It&amp;rsquo;s intense, but totally doable. Ready? Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
